<p> We need some ideas for what kind of websites we can create. The beast ideas are to find real clients: real people that require a websote in order to solve a real problem. We have to think about whether you know someone who has a problem that a website could have solve. They might already have a website, or a section of a website, that exists but isnt't achieving what they want it to achieve.</p>
<p> My ideas for what kind of websites we can create</p>
<ul>
  <li>Busniess/Company Website</li>
  <li>Personal Website</li>
  <li>Brochure Website</li>
  <li>Photo Sharing Website</li>
  <li>Family Website</li>
  <li>Information Website</li>
</ul>

<p> From the list above, the information website took my interest the most. Since I like anime so much, it gave me an idea of making anime wiki. It'll have all the informations, like characters, information about the anime, and etc. I found a lot of good anime sites, but some didnt. Even though the anime was popular, th emakers for that wiki were too lazy to add and decorate the page. So I want to make a wiki for the anime that they deserve, and hopefully make the audience have more interest in that anime then they had before. </p>

<a id="Brief" class="anchor" href="#Brief" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Brief</h3>

<p>The anime that I'm going to used for this cite is called "Mononoke". The anime Mononoke has a traditional japenese theme; the art style, colors, patterns and etc, all are fiiled with antic japanese patterns. This website will have the theme "Japan" and will catch viewers attention with interesting information about the anime.  </p>
<p> Target Audience: Anime fans</p>

<p>You can <a href="https://github.com/blog/821" class="user-mention">@mention</a> a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (<a href="https://github.com/defunkt" class="user-mention">@defunkt</a>), PJ Hyett (<a href="https://github.com/pjhyett" class="user-mention">@pjhyett</a>), and Tom Preston-Werner (<a href="https://github.com/mojombo" class="user-mention">@mojombo</a>) founded GitHub.</p>
